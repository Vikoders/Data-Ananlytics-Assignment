Changes made to a mutable object will affect the original object.\n\nExamples of Mutable Objects:\n\nLists:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_list[0] = 10\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n\nDictionaries:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\nmy_dict[\"age\"] = 31\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}\n\nImmutable Objects\n\nImmutable objects cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object.   \n\nExamples of Immutable Objects:\nNumbers (int, float, complex):\nx = 10\nx += 5\nprint(x)  # Output: 15\n\n\nStrings:\nmy_string = \"Hello\"\nnew_string = my_string + \" World\"\nprint(new_string)  # Output: Hello World\n\n\nTuples:\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n\n\n\n",

Here's a breakdown of the different types:\n\n1. Arithmetic Operators\nThese operators are used to perform mathematical operations.\n\n+ (Addition): Adds two operands.\nPython\nx = 10 + 5\n\n\n- (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.\nPython\nx = 10 - 5\n\n\n*** (Multiplication):** Multiplies two operands.\nPython\nx = 10 * 5\n\n\n/ (Division): Divides the first operand by the second.\nPython\nx = 10 / 5\n\n\n// (Floor Division): Divides the first operand by the second and returns the integer quotient.\nPython\nx = 10 // 3  # Output: 3\n\n\n% (Modulo): Divides the first operand by the second and returns the remainder.\nPython\nx = 10 % 3  # Output: 1\n\n\n**** (Exponentiation):** Raises the first operand to the power of the second.\nPython\nx = 2 ** 3  # Output: 8\n\n\n2. Comparison Operators\nThese operators are used to compare values.\n\n== (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal.\nPython\nx = 10 == 5  # False\n\n\n!= (Not Equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal.\nPython\nx = 10 != 5  # True\n\n\n> (Greater than): Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.\nPython\nx = 10 > 5  # True\n\n\n< (Less than): Checks if the first operand is less than the second.\nPython\nx = 10 < 5  # False\n\n\n>= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.\nPython\nx = 10 >= 5  # True\n\n\n<= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.\nPython\nx = 10 <= 5  # False\n\n\n3. Logical Operators\nThese operators are used to combine conditional statements.\n\nand: Returns True if both operands are True.\nPython\nx = (10 > 5) and (5 < 10)  # True\n\n\nor: Returns True if at least one operand is True.\nPython\nx = (10 > 5) or (5 > 10)  # True\n\n\nnot: Inverts the truth value of an operan\nPython\nx = not (10 > 5)  # False\n\n4. Assignment Operators\nThese operators are used to assign values to variables.\n\n= (Assignment): Assigns a value to a variable.\nPython\nx = 10\n\n+= (Add and Assign): Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result.\nPython\nx += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5\n\n-= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result.\nPython\nx -= 5  # Equivalent to x = x - 5\n\n*= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result.\nPython\nx *= 5  # Equivalent to x = x * 5\n\n/= (Divide and Assign): Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result.\nPython\nx /= 5  # Equivalent to x = x / 5\n\n//= (Floor Divide and Assign): Performs floor division and assigns the result.\nPython\nx //= 5  # Equivalent to x = x // 5\n\n%= (Modulo and Assign): Performs modulo operation and assigns the result.\nPython\nx %= 5  # Equivalent to x = x % 5\n\n\n**= (Exponentiate and Assign): Raises a variable to a power and assigns the result.\nPython\nx **= 2  # Equivalent to x = x ** 2\n",

Illustrate with examples\n\nAns - Conditional Statements in Python\n\nConditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program based on specific conditions. The most common conditional statement is the if statement.   \n\nBasic if Statement:\n\nPython\nif condition:\n    # code to be executed if the condition is True\n\n\nExample:\n\nPython\nx = 10\nif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n\n\nif-else Statement:\n\nPython\nif condition:\n    # code to be executed if the condition is True\nelse:\n    # code to be executed if the condition is False\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nx = 5\nif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 5\")\n\n\nif-elif-else Statement:\n\nPython\nif condition1:\n    # code to be executed if condition1 is True\nelif condition2:\n    # code to be executed if condition1   \n is False and condition2 is True\nelse:\n    # code to be executed if both conditions are False   \n\n\n\nExample:\n\nPython\nx = 10\nif x > 15:\n    print(\"x is greater than 15\")\nelif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 5\")   \n\n\n\nNested if Statements:\n\nYou can nest if statements to create more complex conditions.\n\nPython\nx = 10\ny = 20\n\nif x > 5:\n    if y > 15:\n        print(\"Both x and y are greater than their respective values\")\n    else:\n        print(\"x is greater than 5, but y is less than or equal to 15\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 5\")\n",

      "source": "Q7- Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.\n\nAns - Types of Loops in Python\n\nPython offers two primary types of loops to control the flow of execution: for loops and while loops.\n\n1. For Loops\n\nFor loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers.\n\nSyntax:\n\nPython\nfor element in sequence:\n    # code to be executed for each element\n\n\nExample:\n\nPython\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\n\nExample with Range:\n\nPython\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\n\n2. While Loops\n\nWhile loops execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.\n\nSyntax:\n\nPython\nwhile condition:\n    # code to be executed while the condition is True\n\n\nExample:\n\nPython\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n\n\nUse Cases:\n\nIterating over sequences: For loops are ideal for iterating over lists, tuples, strings, and other sequences.\nRepeating a block of code: While loops are useful for repeating a block of code until a certain condition is met.\nCreating counters: Both for and while loops can be used to create counters.\nProcessing files line by line: For loops can be used to iterate over lines in a file.\nGenerating sequences of numbers: For loops with the range() function can be used to generate sequences of numbers.\nAdditional Considerations:\n\nbreak statement: Can be used to exit a loop prematurely.\ncontinue statement: Can be used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one.\nInfinite loops: Be careful to avoid infinite loops by ensuring that the condition in a while loop eventually becomes False.\nBy understanding and using these loops effectively, you can write more concise and efficient Python code.",
